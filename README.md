# SPH-DEM-and-SSF-Rendering
This repository provides an implementation of a coupled SPH-DEM model for solidâ€“liquid interaction and a screen-space fluid rendering (SSF) method for real-time visualization. It is designed to support research on debris flow and other geohazard simulations by integrating physical computation with interactive visualization

# Hardware requirements:
GPU with at least 8GB of memory.
