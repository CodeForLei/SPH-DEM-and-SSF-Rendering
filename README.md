# SPH-DEM-and-SSF-Rendering
This repository provides an implementation of a coupled SPH-DEM model for solid–liquid interaction and a screen-space fluid rendering (SSF) method for real-time visualization. It is designed to support research on debris flow and other geohazard simulations by integrating physical computation with interactive visualization

# Hardware requirements
GPU with at least 8GB of memory.

# Software required
Unreal Engine 5.3.2
Niagara Plugin
NiagaraFluids Plugin
